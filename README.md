##Assignment 2: Exquisite Corpse Animation
###Gus, Alex, Jennifer

In this assignment, each of us created an animation that uses a separate input to control. Animation 1 uses a button press to affect the audio, using a boolean route. The color in Animation 2 responds to a slider, a range route. And Animation 3 responds to external sounds, also using a range route.

The primary Processing app is Exquisite_Corpse_Template.pde, and the separate input apps are in folders within the Exquisite_Corpse_Template folder, at the same level as the primary app.
